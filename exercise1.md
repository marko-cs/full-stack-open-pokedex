# Warming up - Defining CI/CD pipeline 

Let assume following context where we about 6 person development team and application is developed actively, and it will be released soon. Programming language would be python and objective is to deploy microservices REST api application for master data management. Application will be run on containers. 

First choice would be between on premise and cloud infrastructure and applications to all development, integration and deployment tasks. Choice here is simple, and it would be cloud. Reason and justification would be workload and value on long run. Development team need to focus on development tasks, not maintaining infrastructure or CI/CD applications. In modern world with different kind of cyber risk you can leave our development environments without maintenance. Cloud providers take security quite seriously and keep infrastructure and applications in good shape. 

Next selection would be main CI tools since that cab affect a lot which source code version control system can be selected. Selection approach here would be keep options open for the code repo and focus to optimize container build. Based on those criteria and some quick googling obvious candidate would be CircleCI running on cloud. That can integrated with all major source code version control systems. There are ready-made integrations available for different static code analysis, testing and artifacts tools. Those can be selected based on more detailed analysis. Some obvious candidates would be Postman testing since we are taking about REST api application and Sonar for linting and static code analysis. Artifact repository can be selected according cloud platform.
