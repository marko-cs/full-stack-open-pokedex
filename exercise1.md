Let's assume the following context: we have a 6-person development team, and the application is being developed actively, and it will be released soon. The programming language would be Python, and the objective is to deploy a microservices REST API application for master data management. The application will be run on containers.

The first choice would be between on-premise and cloud infrastructure and applications for all development, integration, and deployment tasks. The choice here is simple, and it would be cloud. Reason and justification would be workload and value in the long run. The development team needs to focus on development tasks, not maintaining infrastructure or CI/CD applications. In the modern world, with different kinds of cyber risk, you can leave our development environments without maintenance. Cloud providers take security quite seriously and keep infrastructure and applications in good shape.

The next selection would be the main CI tools since that can affect a lot, which source code version control system can be selected. The selection approach here would be to keep options open for the code repo and focus on optimizing the container build. Based on those criteria and some quick Googling, an obvious candidate would be CircleCI running on the cloud. That can be integrated with all major source code version control systems. There are ready-made integrations available for different static code analysis, testing, and artifacts tools. Those can be selected based on more detailed analysis. Some obvious candidates would be Postman testing since we are talking about REST API applications and Sonar for linting and static code analysis. Artifact repository can be selected according to the cloud platform.
